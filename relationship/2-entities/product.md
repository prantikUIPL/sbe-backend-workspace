# Product

## What it is
The **reusable catalog item** — a booth, workshop pavilion, sponsorship, or add-on. It defines *what* can be sold (name, dimensions, fee toggles, pricing model) **before** it's tied to any show. One Product can be offered at many shows.

## Relationships, read as sentences
- A Product **is typed as** one **[ProductType](product-type.md)** (N→1) — this is what makes it a booth vs pavilion vs sponsorship vs add-on.
- A Product **may require terms** from one **[Agreement](agreement.md)** before purchase (N→1, `SetNull`).
- A Product **is offered at shows as** many **[ShowProducts](show-product.md)** (1→N).
- A Product **is priced by** flat tiers (`ProductPriceTier`) or by booth-size (`ProductBoothSizePrice`) (1→N).
- A Product **is added to carts as** many **[CartItems](cart-item.md)** (`Restrict`) and **ordered as** many **[OrderItems](order-item.md)** (`SetNull`).

## Why it matters / gotchas
- **A Product is not purchasable on its own** — it must be attached to a [Shows](shows.md) via [ShowProduct](show-product.md) to get a price and stock.
- Booth dimensions/fees and "booth details" live as **columns here** (`length`, `width`, `booth_setup_fee_enabled`, `custom_amount`), not in a separate table.
- `price_type` is `flat` or `booth_size_based` — that decides which pricing table applies.
